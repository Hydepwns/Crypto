How cross sharding works
64 shards - what will be on those (that explanation with ETH1 will be on one shard...libra can be on another shard...) 
ETH1 vs EE- how ETH1 will flip into EE 
ETH2.0 Phrases - what each phrase means, what each phrase stands for
How to execute ether from ETH 2?
Execute state on cross shard and let it be as data hub
Sharding helps eth1 can access data stored on ETH 2 chain
EE is minimizing complexion to the system
Proposal using beacon chain as load balancer and shard as pure computing layers
Creating scripts for layers
Is ETH2 going to break the composability with cross shards calls ? New proposal remedies this. Shards are able to communicate together in one block (without waiting for new epoch - 6mins)
Applications are stored on shards. They can communicate together - cross shard communication
Sharding - scalability model
Using Optimistic roll-up that's reading from multiple shards
Coordinate more data on shards
Asinc model for smart contact devs available for Viper and solidity
Making ETH1 stateless will make transition to ETH2 easier. You will be validator and so You no longer have to have database on disk to manage the large global state. As you're executing the transaction we don't go to the database back and forth it makes that part simplier. 
If you're trying to sync you no longer need to download global state.
Brings significant amount of security as there will be shuffling = you will not validate only one shard but they will shuffling every 6 mins (epoch). 
Shuffling makes difficult to interrupt the committees
And security for the network
Helps with reducing the state of the network = currently facing this problem with eth1 (current Ethereum)
